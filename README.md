# EDx-projects
Assignments from the introductory computational thinking/Python course I took through edx.org prior to starting in university.

Files starting w1 and w2 contain simple programming assignments from the end of week 1 and week 2, ps3 is a Hangman-style game,
ps4 a word guessins game that can be played solo or against the computer, ps6 is a cipher program.
